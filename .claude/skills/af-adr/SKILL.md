  Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — structured documents that capture
  important architectural decisions along with their context, alternatives considered,
  and consequences. Use when the user wants to document a design/technology choice,
  justify an architectural direction, or maintain a decision log for a project.

# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Skill

This skill guides creation of high-quality Architecture Decision Records that are
useful now AND in the future — to your team, to new joiners, and to your future self.

## Project Steering Directives

If `.agent-fox/specs/steering.md` exists in the project root, read it and follow any
directives it contains before proceeding. These project-level directives apply
to all agents and skills working on this project.

---

## Step 1 — Gather Context Before Writing

Before creating the ADR, make sure you understand:

1. **The decision itself** — What was chosen? (e.g. "Use Redis for session storage")
2. **The problem** — What need or constraint drove this decision?
3. **The alternatives** — What other options were considered?
4. **The reasons** — Why was this option chosen over the others?
5. **The trade-offs** — What are the known downsides or risks?
6. **Affected stakeholders** — Who is impacted (teams, systems, users)?
7. **Decision status** — Is this Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded?

If the user hasn't provided enough information on any of these, ask targeted questions.
Do NOT invent details — a vague but honest ADR is better than a confident but inaccurate one.

### Source of Truth: The Code Wins

**Explore the codebase:** run `ls`, read key source files, understand the
   module structure and how components interact.

**The code is the single source of truth.** Read the code in depth, understand
how the system works. Don't skim.Documentation (READMEs, wikis, inline comments,
commit messages, etc.) frequently diverges from what was actually implemented.
When documentation and code disagree, **the code is always right**.
Use documentation as a starting hint, but verify every claim against the
actual implementation before including it in the ADR.

**Important:** Only read files tracked by git. Skip anything matched by
`.gitignore`. When in doubt, run `git ls-files` to see what's tracked.

---

## Step 2 — Determine File Location and Name

### Directory

Look for an existing ADR directory in this priority order:

1. `docs/adr/`
2. `doc/adr/`
3. `adr/`
4. `docs/decisions/`
5. `decisions/`

If none exists, create `docs/adr/` and note this in your response.

### ADR file naming

- **Format:** `NN-imperative-verb-phrase.md` (e.g. `01-use-postgresql-for-primary-database.md`).
- **NN** is a zero-padded running number (01, 02, 03, …) indicating the order the ADR was created.
- **To choose the next number when creating a new ADR:**
  1. List the contents of the ADR directory.
  2. Find existing files whose names start with digits and a hyphen (e.g. `01-*`, `02-*`). If none exist, use `01`.
  3. Take the maximum numeric prefix and use the next number, zero-padded to two digits for consistency (e.g. after `03-foo` use `04-new-decision`).
- Use a specific, imperative verb phrase in lowercase-with-hyphens (e.g. `use-redis-for-session-cache`, `adopt-hexagonal-architecture`).
- Present-tense imperative verb (use, adopt, replace, migrate, define, choose).

**Uniqueness check:** After choosing the next number, verify that no existing file in the ADR directory already uses that prefix. If a collision is found (e.g., a file was manually created with the same number), increment until a unique prefix is available. Flag the collision to the user as a warning.

## Step 3 — Write the ADR Using This Template

```markdown
---
Title: {NNNN}. {Title in sentence case}
Date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
Status: {Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by [ADR-NNNN](NNNN-filename.md)}
---
## Context

{Describe the situation, forces, and constraints that make this decision necessary.
Include: the problem being solved, relevant technical constraints, organizational
or team context, any external drivers (compliance, performance SLAs, partner APIs).
Write this as if explaining to a smart engineer who just joined the team and has
no background on the situation. This section should NOT mention the decision itself —
only the forces that make a decision necessary.}

## Decision Drivers

- {Key requirement or constraint 1}
- {Key requirement or constraint 2}
- {Key non-functional requirement (e.g. performance, security, maintainability)}
- {Team skill or operational consideration}

## Options Considered

### Option A: {Name}
{Brief description}

**Pros:**
- {Advantage}

**Cons:**
- {Disadvantage or risk}

### Option B: {Name}
{Brief description}

**Pros:**
- {Advantage}

**Cons:**
- {Disadvantage or risk}

### Option C: {Name} *(if applicable)*
{Repeat pattern}

## Decision

We will **{chosen option}** because {primary rationale — connect directly to the
decision drivers above. Be specific. Avoid vague language like "it's the best fit".
Say WHY it's the best fit for YOUR situation.}

## Consequences

### Positive
- {Benefit 1}
- {Benefit 2}

### Negative / Trade-offs
- {Known downside or accepted risk}
- {Technical debt incurred, if any}

### Neutral / Follow-up actions
- {Related ADR that will now be needed — link if it exists}
- {Migration step, infrastructure work, or team training required}
- {Review date or trigger condition for revisiting this decision}

## References

- {Link to relevant RFC, spike, design doc, or ticket}
- {External documentation, benchmark results, or prior art}
```

## Step 4 — Quality Checklist Before Saving

Go through each item before writing the file:

- [ ] **Context explains WHY a decision is needed** — not what was decided
- [ ] **At least two real alternatives** are documented with honest trade-offs
- [ ] **Decision rationale connects to the drivers** — not generic praise
- [ ] **Consequences include negatives** — a one-sided ADR is not trustworthy
- [ ] **No vague language**: avoid "best practice", "industry standard", "obvious choice" without evidence
- [ ] **Timestamps are present** — future readers need to understand when this was written
- [ ] **Status is set** — every ADR must have a status
- [ ] **File name uses imperative verb phrase** in lowercase-with-hyphens

---

## Best Practices (Apply These Always)

**Write for your future self at 2am during an incident.**
The person reading this ADR may be stressed, may not have context, and may be
deciding whether to change something. Make the "why" unmistakably clear.

**One decision per ADR.**
If you're deciding two things, write two ADRs. Cross-reference them.

**Immutability by default.**
Don't edit the substance of an accepted ADR. Instead:
- Add a dated note at the bottom if new information comes in
- Create a new ADR and mark this one as "Superseded by [ADR-NNNN]"

**Document rejected options with the same care as the chosen one.**
Future engineers will re-evaluate the same alternatives. Save them the time.

**Be specific about your context.**
"We chose X because of our team size of 8 engineers and our 99.5% SLA" is far
more useful than "X scales better."

**Avoid abbreviations and internal jargon** in the Context section — this is your
most likely entry point for new team members.

## Domain-Specific Guidance

### Safety-Critical / Mixed-Criticality Systems (ASIL, ISO 26262, etc.)
Add these additional sections when the decision has safety implications:

```markdown
## Safety & Compliance Impact

- ASIL level affected: {None | A | B | C | D}
- Compliance frameworks impacted: {ISO 26262, IEC 61508, etc.}
- Safety argument: {How does this decision support or affect the safety case?}
- Requires safety review by: {name/role}
```

### API / Interface Decisions
Include backward compatibility stance, versioning strategy, and contract owners.

### Build vs. Buy vs. OSS Decisions
Include: license type, support model, community health, total cost of ownership
estimate, and vendor lock-in risk.

### Infrastructure / Cloud Decisions
Include: cost impact (estimated), regional availability, disaster recovery implications,
and operational team readiness.

## Example Output

For reference, a complete minimal ADR looks like this:

```markdown
---
Title: 04. Use NATS as the message broker for vehicle service events
Date: 2025-03-12
Status: Accepted
---
## Context

Our mixed-criticality automotive demo requires reliable, low-latency message passing
between Android Automotive OS applications and ASIL-B services running on RHIVOS.
We need a broker that supports both cloud-native and embedded deployment patterns,
has predictable latency under load, and can be self-hosted to meet automotive
data residency requirements. The team has no existing broker infrastructure.

## Decision Drivers

- Sub-10ms P99 latency requirement for door lock event propagation
- Must run on-vehicle (edge) without cloud connectivity
- Small operational footprint — no Zookeeper or heavy dependencies
- Team has existing Go expertise (NATS has a first-class Go client)

## Options Considered

### Option A: Apache Kafka
Mature, widely adopted, strong ecosystem.

**Pros:** Battle-tested at scale, rich tooling, strong ordering guarantees.
**Cons:** Heavy operational burden (Zookeeper/KRaft), high memory footprint,
not designed for edge/embedded deployment, overkill for our message volume.

### Option B: NATS
Lightweight, cloud-native and edge-capable message broker written in Go.

**Pros:** ~20MB binary, JetStream for persistence, runs on-vehicle,
excellent Go client, CNCF project with active development.
**Cons:** Smaller ecosystem than Kafka, JetStream is relatively newer.

### Option C: MQTT (Mosquitto)
Purpose-built for IoT/embedded messaging.

**Pros:** Extremely lightweight, well-understood in automotive.
**Cons:** No built-in persistence without extensions, weaker stream semantics,
less suited to service-to-service RPC patterns we also need.

## Decision

We will **use NATS with JetStream** because it is the only evaluated option that
satisfies our latency requirement, runs on-vehicle without a cloud dependency,
and aligns with our team's Go expertise. The JetStream persistence layer covers
our audit trail requirement for parking transaction events.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Single broker handles both pub/sub events and request/reply patterns
- On-vehicle deployment eliminates cloud round-trip for safety-critical paths

### Negative / Trade-offs
- Team must learn JetStream consumer group patterns (estimated 1-week ramp-up)
- Smaller community means fewer off-the-shelf integrations

### Neutral / Follow-up actions
- ADR-0005 will address NATS authentication and TLS configuration
- Integration testing harness needed before demo milestone (sprint 4)
- Revisit if message volume exceeds 50k/sec sustained
