  Analyze spec compliance and detect drift between specifications and code.
  Compares requirements.md, design.md, and test_spec.md against actual
  implementation, traces execution paths, verifies test coverage, accounts
  for spec supersession, and produces a compliance report with actionable
  mitigation suggestions. Use when the user wants to audit how well the code
  matches the specs, detect drift, or plan corrective specs.

# Spec Audit & Drift Detection

You are a senior quality engineer performing a spec compliance audit. Your job
is to compare what the specifications in `.agent-fox/specs/` say should be built against
what was actually built in the codebase. You produce a structured compliance
report listing covered requirements, drifted requirements, unimplemented
requirements, and superseded requirements — with actionable mitigation
suggestions for each drift item.

Follow the steps below **in order**. Do not skip steps.

## Project Steering Directives

If `.agent-fox/specs/steering.md` exists in the project root, read it and follow any
directives it contains before proceeding. These project-level directives apply
to all agents and skills working on this project.

---

## Step 1: Discover and Read Specs

Scan the `.agent-fox/specs/` directory for specification folders.

### Discovery Rules

1. List all directories in `.agent-fox/specs/` whose names match the pattern
   `NN_snake_case_name` (where NN is a numeric prefix, e.g. `01_fast_planning`, `100_maintainer_archetype`).
2. Process specs in **ascending numeric order** (01 before 02 before 03, etc.).
3. For each valid spec folder, read these files:
   - `requirements.md` — EARS-patterned acceptance criteria and edge cases.
   - `design.md` — interfaces, data models, correctness properties, error
     handling table, execution paths.
   - `test_spec.md` — test contracts mapped to requirements and properties
     (TS-NN-N, TS-NN-PN, TS-NN-EN, TS-NN-SMOKE-N entries).
   - `tasks.md` — task groups with checkbox state (for completion tracking).
   - `prd.md` — for supersession declarations (`## Supersedes` section).
4. Only read files tracked by git. Skip anything matched by `.gitignore`.
   When in doubt, run `git ls-files` to see what's tracked.

### Error Handling

- IF a spec folder is missing `requirements.md` or `design.md`, THEN **skip**
  that spec and log a warning in the report: "Spec NN_name: skipped — missing
  requirements.md/design.md."
- IF a spec folder is missing `test_spec.md`, THEN **log a warning** in the
  report ("Spec NN_name: test_spec.md missing — test coverage analysis
  skipped for this spec") and continue. Do not skip the spec entirely.
- IF a spec folder name does not match the expected pattern (e.g. missing
  numeric prefix, non-standard naming), THEN **skip** it and log a warning.
- IF `.agent-fox/specs/` contains **no valid spec folders**, THEN report
  "No specs found in .agent-fox/specs/ — nothing to audit." and stop.

### Output of This Step

A list of spec entries, each containing:
- Spec number and name
- Parsed requirements (IDs and text)
- Design interfaces, data models, and execution paths
- Test spec entries (TS-NN-N, TS-NN-PN, TS-NN-EN, TS-NN-SMOKE-N)
- Task completion state (checked vs. unchecked checkboxes)

---

## Step 2: Build Supersession Chain

Determine which specs (or individual requirements) have been superseded by
later specs. Later specs — those with a higher numeric prefix — can
legitimately change or override requirements from earlier specs.

### Explicit Supersession

Check each spec's `prd.md` for a `## Supersedes` section. If found, mark all
requirements from the superseded spec as "superseded" and exclude them from
drift analysis.

Example:
```markdown
## Supersedes
- `09_bundled_templates` — fully replaced by this spec.
```

### Implicit Supersession (Superseded by Implication)

Even without an explicit `## Supersedes` section, a later spec may redefine
behavior originally specified in an earlier spec. Detect this by:

1. Comparing the module references in each spec's `design.md`.
2. If spec N (higher number) defines requirements covering the **same
   module, function, or behavior** as spec M (lower number), flag spec M's
   overlapping requirements as "superseded by implication" and note which
   later spec supersedes them.
3. Use the requirement text and EARS patterns to confirm behavioral overlap —
   don't flag unrelated requirements that happen to reference the same module.

### Compute Effective Requirements

The **effective requirements** are the union of all non-superseded requirements
across all specs, with later specs taking precedence for overlapping behavior.

### Edge Cases

- IF two specs of different numbers both claim to supersede the same earlier
  spec, THEN use the higher-numbered spec as the effective superseder and log
  a warning.
- IF a supersession reference points to a spec that does not exist, THEN log
  a warning and ignore the supersession declaration.

---

## Step 3: Analyze the Codebase

Read the source code to understand what was actually built.

### Reading Strategy

1. Read source files in the project, respecting `.gitignore` exclusions.
   Focus on the main source directory (e.g. `agent_fox/`, `src/`, or
   whatever the project uses).
2. Use the module references in `design.md` to map spec requirements to
   actual source files. For each module referenced in a spec's design doc,
   locate the corresponding file in the codebase.
3. Read the code in depth — don't skim. Understand function signatures,
   class definitions, data models (dataclasses, enums, protocols), and
   control flow.

### Design Document Comparison

For each spec's `design.md`:
- Compare **function signatures** defined in the design doc against actual
  function signatures in the codebase. Note differences in parameter names,
  types, return types, or missing/extra parameters.
- Compare **data model definitions** (dataclasses, enums, protocols) in the
  design doc against actual definitions in the code. Note missing fields,
  extra fields, type mismatches, or renamed classes.
- Compare the **error handling table** in the design doc against actual error
  handling behavior in the code. Check that each documented error condition
  produces the specified behavior.

### Execution Path Tracing

For each execution path defined in the `## Execution Paths` section of
`design.md`, verify the path is **live in production code**:

1. **Trace the call chain.** Starting from the entry point, read each function
   in the chain and confirm it actually calls the next function listed. Do not
   assume — read the calling code.
2. **Detect stubs.** Search for `return []`, `return None` on non-Optional
   returns, `pass` in non-abstract methods, `raise NotImplementedError`, and
   `# TODO`/`# stub` comments in functions along the path. Each hit is a
   potential wiring gap.
3. **Verify return value propagation.** For every function in the path that
   returns data consumed by the next step, confirm the caller receives and
   uses the return value. Grep for callers that discard the return value.
4. **Cross-spec entry points.** If a path's entry point is owned by another
   spec, confirm the upstream caller exists in production code (not only in
   tests).

Mark each execution path as:
- **Live** — fully wired, no stubs, return values propagate.
- **Broken** — one or more links in the chain are missing, stubbed, or
  return values are discarded.
- **Partial** — entry point exists but some intermediate links are stubbed.

### Test Coverage Verification

For each spec that has a `test_spec.md`, verify that test contracts were
translated into actual executable tests:

1. **Acceptance criterion tests (TS-NN-N).** For each entry, search the test
   directories for a corresponding test function or class. Check that the test
   file exists and the test exercises the behavior described in the test spec
   entry.
2. **Property tests (TS-NN-PN).** For each entry, search for a corresponding
   property-based test (e.g., using Hypothesis `@given` decorator or
   equivalent). Verify the test generates inputs matching the "For any"
   quantifier in the test spec.
3. **Edge case tests (TS-NN-EN).** For each entry, search for a corresponding
   test that exercises the specific edge case.
4. **Integration smoke tests (TS-NN-SMOKE-N).** For each entry:
   - Verify the test file exists.
   - Verify the test exercises the full execution path (not a subset).
   - Verify the test does NOT mock components that the test spec says must
     not be mocked (the components named in the execution path).

Report each test spec entry as:
- **Implemented** — a matching test exists and tests the right behavior.
- **Missing** — no corresponding test found.
- **Stale** — a test exists but tests different behavior than the test spec
  describes (e.g., the test spec was updated but the test was not).

### Correctness Property Coverage

For each correctness property in `design.md`:
1. Verify a corresponding property test exists (matching `TS-NN-PN`).
2. Verify the property test's invariant matches the property statement.
3. If the property references specific requirements, verify those requirements
   are also covered by acceptance criterion tests.

### Edge Cases

- IF a module referenced in `design.md` does not exist in the codebase, THEN
  report it as an unimplemented component.
- IF a source file exists but is empty, THEN treat it as unimplemented.
- IF `design.md` does not contain typed interfaces (e.g. early or informal
  specs), THEN skip interface comparison for that spec and note it in the
  report.
- IF `design.md` does not contain an `## Execution Paths` section, THEN skip
  execution path tracing for that spec and note it in the report.
- IF `test_spec.md` is missing, THEN skip test coverage verification for that
  spec (already warned in Step 1).

---

## Step 4: Classify Each Requirement

For each effective requirement (from Step 2), compare it against the code
analysis (from Step 3) and classify it into exactly one category:

### Classification Categories

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Compliant** | The code behavior matches the spec's acceptance criteria. |
| **Drifted** | The code behavior diverges from the spec. |
| **Unimplemented** | No corresponding code exists for this requirement. |
| **Superseded** | This requirement was overridden by a later spec. |

### Drift Types

When a requirement is classified as "Drifted", assign a drift type:

| Drift Type | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `behavioral` | The code does something different from what the spec says. |
| `structural` | The architecture, interfaces, or data models differ from the design doc. |
| `missing-edge-case` | The happy path works, but edge case handling differs from the spec. |
| `broken-path` | An execution path from design.md is not live in production code (stubbed, unwired, or return values discarded). |
| `missing-test` | A test spec entry (TS-NN-*) has no corresponding executable test in the codebase. |
| `stale-test` | A test exists but tests different behavior than the current test spec describes. |

### Drift Details

For each drifted requirement, describe:
1. **Spec says** — what the requirement specifies (quote the EARS text).
2. **Code does** — what the code actually does (describe the observed behavior).

### Partial Implementation

IF a requirement is partially implemented (some acceptance criteria met, others
not), THEN classify it as "Drifted" and list which criteria are met vs. not met.

---

## Step 5: Handle In-Progress Specs

Not all specs may be fully implemented. Distinguish between genuine drift and
expected gaps from work still in progress.

### Completion State Check

1. For each spec, read `tasks.md` and count checked (`- [x]`) vs. unchecked
   (`- [ ]`) items. Calculate the **completion percentage**.
2. A spec is "in-progress" if it has any unchecked items in `tasks.md`.

### Classification Rules

- WHEN a spec's `tasks.md` contains unchecked items, classify unimplemented
  requirements from that spec as **expected gaps** rather than drift. Report
  them in a dedicated "In-Progress Caveats" section, separate from drift.
- **Important exception:** IF a spec has **all tasks.md items checked** but
  requirements are still unimplemented, THEN classify those as "Drifted" (not
  "in progress"), since the work was marked as complete.

---

## Step 6: Suggest Mitigations

For each drifted requirement, suggest exactly one mitigation:

### Mitigation Types

| Mitigation | When to Use | Meaning |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Change spec** | The code behavior appears to be an intentional improvement or evolution beyond what the spec describes. | Update the spec to match the code — the spec is stale, the code is correct. |
| **Get well spec** | The code behavior appears to be a regression, omission, or unintentional deviation. | Create a corrective spec to bring the code back in line with the original intent. |
| **Needs manual review** | You cannot determine whether drift is intentional or unintentional. | Flag for human decision — explain the ambiguity. |

### Decision Heuristics

Use these heuristics to choose between "Change spec" and "Get well spec":

- **Change spec** signals:
  - The code adds functionality beyond the spec (enhancement, not omission).
  - The code uses a different but reasonable approach to achieve the same goal.
  - A later spec's implementation naturally altered this behavior as a side effect.
  - The code reflects common patterns or best practices that the spec didn't anticipate.

- **Get well spec** signals:
  - The code is missing a required behavior that the spec explicitly calls out.
  - An edge case specified in the requirements is not handled.
  - The code contradicts the spec's intent (does the opposite).
  - An error condition specified in the design doc is not handled.
  - An execution path from design.md is broken or stubbed (`broken-path`).
  - A test spec entry has no corresponding test (`missing-test`).
  - A smoke test mocks components the test spec says must not be mocked.

### Priority Assignment

Assign a priority to each mitigation:

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| `high` | Functional impact — user-facing behavior is wrong or missing. |
| `medium` | Structural divergence — interfaces, data models, or architecture differ but behavior may be acceptable. |
| `low` | Minor or cosmetic differences — naming, ordering, formatting. |

---

## Step 7: Detect Extra Behavior (Best-Effort)

Perform a **best-effort scan** for notable code behavior that does not trace to
any spec requirement.

- Compare the list of modules and functions in the codebase against the modules
  referenced in any spec's `design.md`.
- If you notice significant functionality (commands, API endpoints, major
  classes) that aren't covered by any spec, mention them in a dedicated
  "Extra Behavior" section.
- This is best-effort — do not perform an exhaustive search. Note obvious
  unspecified behavior if spotted during analysis.
- IF no extra behavior is detected, omit the "Extra Behavior" section or state
  "None detected."

---

## Step 8: Generate the Audit Report

Produce the compliance report and save it.

### Report Template

Use this exact structure:

```markdown
# Spec Audit Report

**Generated:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Branch:** {current git branch}
**Specs analyzed:** {count}

## Summary

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Compliant | N |
| Drifted | N |
| Unimplemented | N |
| Superseded | N |
| In-progress (expected gaps) | N |
| Execution paths live | N |
| Execution paths broken/partial | N |
| Test spec entries implemented | N |
| Test spec entries missing | N |

## Compliant Requirements

| Requirement | Spec | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| NN-REQ-X.Y | NN_spec_name | Brief description |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Drifted Requirements

### NN-REQ-X.Y: {title}

**Spec says:** {what the requirement specifies}
**Code does:** {what the code actually does}
**Drift type:** {behavioral | structural | missing-edge-case}
**Suggested mitigation:** {Change spec | Get well spec | Needs manual review}
**Priority:** {high | medium | low}
**Rationale:** {why this mitigation is suggested}

---

(Repeat for each drifted requirement)

## Unimplemented Requirements

| Requirement | Spec | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| NN-REQ-X.Y | NN_spec_name | Brief description |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Superseded Requirements

| Requirement | Original Spec | Superseded By | Type |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|------|
| NN-REQ-X.Y | NN_spec_name | MM_spec_name | explicit / implicit |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Execution Path Status

| Spec | Path | Status | Details |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| NN_spec_name | Path 1: {name} | Live / Broken / Partial | {brief detail} |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Broken Paths

#### NN_spec_name — Path N: {name}

**Design says:** {call chain from design.md}
**Code does:** {what actually happens — which link is broken, stubbed, or discarded}
**Gap:** {stub at function X / return value discarded at step Y / entry point not called}

---

(Repeat for each broken or partial path)

## Test Coverage

### NN_spec_name

| Test Spec Entry | Type | Status | Test File |
|-----------------|------|--------|-----------|
| TS-NN-1 | unit | Implemented / Missing / Stale | tests/test_foo.py::test_bar |
| TS-NN-P1 | property | Implemented / Missing / Stale | tests/property/test_foo.py::test_prop |
| TS-NN-E1 | edge-case | Implemented / Missing / Stale | — |
| TS-NN-SMOKE-1 | smoke | Implemented / Missing / Stale | tests/integration/test_smoke.py |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Coverage:** X/Y entries implemented (ZZ%)

## In-Progress Caveats

### NN_spec_name (completion: XX%)

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| NN-REQ-X.Y | Expected gap | Task group N not yet implemented |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Extra Behavior (Best-Effort)

- {Description of notable unspecified behavior, if any}

## Mitigation Summary

| Requirement | Mitigation | Priority |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| NN-REQ-X.Y | Change spec | high |
| NN-REQ-X.Y | Get well spec | medium |
| NN-REQ-X.Y | Needs manual review | low |
| ... | ... | ... |
```

### Output

1. **Save** the report as `docs/audits/audit-report-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` (using
   today's date as the timestamp). If the `docs/audits/` directory does not
   exist, create it first.
2. **Display** the full report in the conversation so the user can review it
   immediately.

### Create GitHub Issues for Drifted Requirements

After saving the report, create one GitHub issue per entry in the
**Drifted Requirements** section. This turns each drift item into a trackable
work item.

#### Determine the repository

Detect `owner` and `repo` from the git remote:

```bash
git remote get-url origin
```

Parse the remote URL (HTTPS or SSH) to extract `{owner}` and `{repo}`.
If the remote URL cannot be parsed (e.g., no remote configured, non-GitHub
host), **skip issue creation silently** — do not warn, do not halt. Proceed
to the next step.

#### Issue format

For each drifted requirement, create an issue using the same formatting as
the report entry:

**Title:** `[Spec Drift] {NN-REQ-X.Y}: {title}`

**Body:**

```markdown
### {NN-REQ-X.Y}: {title}

**Spec says:** {what the requirement specifies}
**Code does:** {what the code actually does}
**Drift type:** {behavioral | structural | missing-edge-case}
**Suggested mitigation:** {Change spec | Get well spec | Needs manual review}
**Priority:** {high | medium | low}
**Rationale:** {why this mitigation is suggested}

---
*Auto-generated by `af-spec-audit`.*
```

**Labels:** Apply labels when available on the repository:
- `spec-drift`
- Priority label: `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, or `priority:low`
  (matching the mitigation priority)

If a label does not exist on the repository, omit it — do not attempt to
create labels.

#### Create the issue

```bash
gh issue create --repo {owner}/{repo} --title "{title}" --body "{body}" --label "{labels}"
```

Print progress for each issue:
```
[af-spec-audit] Created issue #{issue_number}: [Spec Drift] {NN-REQ-X.Y}
```

#### Failure handling

If creating an issue fails for any reason (network error, permissions,
authentication, rate limiting), **silently skip GitHub issue creation and continue** with
the remaining drift items. Do not warn, do not halt, do not retry.

After all issues are processed (or skipped), continue to the next step.

---

## Parsing Reference

These patterns appear in spec files. Use them to parse requirements and design
documents consistently.

| Pattern | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Spec folder name | `\d{2}_[a-z_]+` | `05_structured_memory` |
| Requirement ID | `NN-REQ-X.Y` | `05-REQ-3.2` |
| Edge case ID | `NN-REQ-X.EY` | `05-REQ-3.E1` |
| EARS keywords | WHEN, WHILE, WHERE, SHALL, IF, THEN | uppercase |
| Supersedes heading | `## Supersedes` | in prd.md |
| Dependencies heading | `## Dependencies` | in prd.md |
| Execution paths heading | `## Execution Paths` | in design.md |
| Correctness properties heading | `## Correctness Properties` | in design.md |
| Test spec entry (acceptance) | `TS-NN-N` | `TS-05-3` |
| Test spec entry (property) | `TS-NN-PN` | `TS-05-P2` |
| Test spec entry (edge case) | `TS-NN-EN` | `TS-05-E1` |
| Test spec entry (smoke) | `TS-NN-SMOKE-N` | `TS-05-SMOKE-1` |
| Checkbox unchecked | `- [ ]` | tasks.md |
| Checkbox checked | `- [x]` | tasks.md |
| Checkbox in-progress | `- [-]` | tasks.md |

---

## Guidelines

- **The code is the source of truth for behavior.** The spec is the source of
  truth for intent. Your job is to measure the gap.
- **Read the code in depth.** Don't skim. Understand how modules interact,
  what functions actually do, and what error conditions are handled.
- **Be precise.** When reporting drift, quote the specific requirement text and
  describe the specific code behavior. Avoid vague statements like "the code
  doesn't match."
- **Be fair.** Not all divergence is bad. Code that exceeds spec requirements
  is not necessarily drifted — it may be an enhancement that the spec should
  acknowledge.
- **Account for evolution.** Always check whether a later spec explains a
  divergence before flagging it as drift.
