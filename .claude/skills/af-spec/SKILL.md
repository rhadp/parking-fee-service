# Spec-Driven Development Skill

You are a requirements engineer and software architect. Your job is to take a
product requirements document (PRD) or a product idea and produce a complete
specification package consisting of four artifacts:

1. **Requirements Document** (EARS syntax)
2. **Design Document** (with Correctness Properties)
3. **Test Specification** (executable test contracts)
4. **Implementation Tasks Document** (trackable checklist + verification plan)

Follow the steps below **in order**. Do not skip steps.

## Project Steering Directives

If `.agent-fox/specs/steering.md` exists in the project root, read it and follow any
directives it contains before proceeding. These project-level directives apply
to all agents and skills working on this project.

---

## Step 1: Understand the PRD

Read and internalize the PRD or prompt provided by the user.

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is a file path, read that file as the PRD.
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is a GitHub issue URL, fetch the issue text from GitHub
  (see **GitHub Issue Input** below) and treat it as the PRD.
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is a description or prompt, treat it as the PRD directly.
- If no argument is given, ask the user for a PRD or product description.

Every spec folder must contain all five documents: `prd.md`, `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `test_spec.md`, `tasks.md`.

### GitHub Issue Input

When `$ARGUMENTS` matches a GitHub issue URL
(e.g. `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}`), parse out `owner`,
`repo`, and `issue_number`, then retrieve the issue using the **github MCP
`get_issue`** tool. Read the initial issue and all comments.

Use the issue **title** and **body** as the raw PRD text. If the issue body is
empty or insufficient, ask the user for additional context before proceeding.

Keep `owner`, `repo`, and `issue_number` in memory — they are needed at the end
of this step to post the finalized PRD back to GitHub.

### Identify and Resolve Issues

**Critical:** Before proceeding, identify and surface any issues:

- **Ambiguities**: Requirements that can be interpreted in more than one way.
- **Inconsistencies**: Requirements that contradict each other.
- **Underspecification**: Missing details needed for implementation (e.g., error
  handling, edge cases, data formats, supported platforms).
- **Implicit assumptions**: Things the PRD takes for granted that should be
  explicit.

Present all issues to the user as a numbered list grouped by category. Ask the
user to clarify each one.

#### If the user delegates decisions to you

If the user responds with something like "use your judgement", "your decision",
"go on", "continue", or any other indication that they want you to decide rather
than provide specific answers:

1. **Think through every issue deeply.** For each ambiguity, inconsistency, or
   gap, reason through the trade-offs, consider the project context, existing
   codebase conventions, and the most pragmatic path forward.
2. **Make a concrete decision for each issue.** Do not leave anything open or
   mark it as "TBD".
3. **Rewrite the PRD** incorporating all your decisions. Add a
   `## Design Decisions` section at the end that lists each issue you resolved
   and the rationale behind your choice. Format as a numbered list matching the
   original issue numbers so the user can trace each decision.
4. **Save the rewritten PRD** and proceed directly to Step 2 without further
   prompting.

#### If the user provides specific answers

Record their answers and ask if they want:

- you to add their answers to the PRD, in a `## Clarifications` section, or
- you to improve the original PRD with their clarifications and rewrite the
  original PRD for them.

### Save the PRD

Regardless of how the PRD was provided, **always** create `.agent-fox/specs/NN_specification_name/prd.md`.

- If the PRD was a file, copy its content into the spec folder's `prd.md`.
- If the PRD was a prompt, save the prompt text into the spec folder's `prd.md`.
- If the PRD was a GitHub issue, save the finalized PRD (with all
  clarifications incorporated) into the spec folder's `prd.md`.

Every `prd.md` **must** end with a `## Source` section that records where the
PRD input came from. This section is mandatory — never omit it.

- **GitHub issue:** `Source: <full issue URL>` (e.g.
  `Source: https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/42`).
- **File:** `Source: <path to the file that was read>` (e.g.
  `Source: docs/draft-prd.md`).
- **User prompt:** `Source: Input provided by <user> via interactive prompt`.

### Post Finalized PRD to GitHub

If the PRD originated from a GitHub issue, post the finalized PRD back as a
comment on the original issue using the **github MCP `add_issue_comment`** tool.

Format the comment as:

```
## Finalized PRD

> This PRD was generated from this issue using the af-spec skill.
> It incorporates all clarifications discussed during requirements analysis.

{finalized PRD content}
```

If posting fails, warn the user but do not block the rest of the workflow.

**Do NOT proceed to Step 2 until all issues are resolved** (either by the user
or by your own decisions if the user delegated to you).

After the PRD is finalized, proceed through Steps 2-6 without pausing for
review. Generate all remaining spec documents in sequence. The user will review
the complete set of spec documents once all five are written.

---

## Step 2: Learn the Context

Analyze the contents of the current working directory. If you detect an
existing codebase, analyze code and repository structure before drafting specs.

Look for existing specifications in `.agent-fox/specs/`. Specification folders use a
**numbered prefix** indicating creation sequence (see below).
Also check steering and workflow docs (`AGENTS.md`, `.agent-fox/prompts/`) so the
generated tasks fit the required execution workflow.

### Specification folder naming

- **Format:** `NN_snake_case_name` (e.g. `01_base_app`, `102_feature_update`).
- **NN** is a running number indicating the order the spec was created.
- **To choose the next number when creating a new spec:**
  1. List the contents of `.agent-fox/specs/`.
  2. Find existing folders whose names start with digits and an underscore (e.g. `01_*`, `102_*`). If none exist, use `01`.
  3. Take the maximum numeric prefix and use the next number (e.g. after `99_foo` use `100_new_spec`).
- Use a short, descriptive `snake_case_name` for the specification (e.g. `stream_rendering`, `color_coding`).

**Uniqueness check:** After choosing the next number, verify that no existing folder in `.agent-fox/specs/` already uses that prefix. If a collision is found (e.g., a folder was manually created with the same number), increment
until a unique prefix is available. Flag the collision to the user as a warning.

### Cross-Spec Dependencies

When analyzing existing specs, identify any that the new spec depends on or
modifies. Record these in the PRD under a `## Dependencies` section using
**task-group-level** granularity. The dependency table declares edges that the
deterministic planner uses to build the task graph.

**Critical: Maximize Parallelism.** For each dependency, identify the
**earliest group** in the upstream spec that produces the artifact being
depended on. Do NOT default to depending on the last group of the upstream
spec — that serializes work unnecessarily. Read the upstream spec's `tasks.md`
and find the first group whose output satisfies the dependency.

**Always use the group-level dependency format** (shown below). Never use the
standard two-column format (`| This Spec | Depends On |`), which resolves to
last-group-to-first-group and prevents fine-grained parallelism.

#### Dependency Table Format

```markdown
## Dependencies

| Spec | From Group | To Group | Relationship |
|------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 01_agent_fox | 3 | 1 | Imports CLI registration from group 3 |
| 03_session_progress | 2 | 4 | Uses session state format produced in group 2 |
```

Column definitions:

- **Spec**: The name of the dependency spec (e.g. `01_agent_fox`).
- **From Group**: The task group number in the dependency spec that produces the
  needed artifact. This is the earliest group whose output the current spec
  consumes.
- **To Group**: The task group number in the current spec that first needs the
  artifact. This is the earliest group in the current spec that depends on the
  artifact.
- **Relationship**: A short description of what the dependency provides,
  including a brief justification of **why the chosen From Group is the
  earliest sufficient one** (e.g., "Imports CLI registration from group 3;
  group 3 is where the CLI entry point is first defined").

#### How to Determine Group Numbers

1. **From Group** — Read the dependency spec's `tasks.md` and find the earliest
   task group that produces the artifact the current spec needs. For example, if
   the current spec imports a type defined in task group 3 of `01_agent_fox`,
   set `From Group` to `3`.
2. **To Group** — Examine the current spec's task plan (being drafted in Step 6)
   and identify the earliest task group that first requires the artifact. For
   example, if the current spec first uses the imported type in task group 1,
   set `To Group` to `1`.
3. **Fallback** — If the dependency spec's `tasks.md` does not exist yet (e.g.,
   the dependency spec is being created concurrently), use `0` as the
   `From Group` sentinel value and add a note in the `Relationship` column:
   `"(From Group TBD — upstream spec not yet planned; using sentinel 0)"`.
   The sentinel `0` signals to the planner that this dependency needs to be
   resolved once the upstream spec is created.

#### When There Are No Dependencies

If the current spec has no cross-spec dependencies, omit the `## Dependencies`
section entirely from `prd.md`, or include the section with an empty table
(header and separator only, no data rows).

If the new spec **supersedes** an existing spec, also add a superseding notice.

### IMPORTANT RULES

- If there are `.gitignore` files in the working directory or any of its sub-directories, ignore files specified there when analyzing the repository.
- Reuse existing naming and architecture terms; avoid introducing synonyms for the same concept.

---

## Step 3: Create the Requirements Document

Create a requirements document at `.agent-fox/specs/{number}_{specification}/requirements.md` using the **EARS
(Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)** pattern.

### EARS Pattern Reference

EARS defines five requirement patterns. Use the appropriate pattern for each requirement:

| Pattern       | Template                                                                      | Use When                              |
|:------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------- |
| Ubiquitous    | THE \<system\> SHALL \<action\>                                               | Always-active behavior                |
| Event-Driven  | WHEN \<trigger\>, THE \<system\> SHALL \<action\>                             | Response to an event                  |
| Complex-Event | WHEN \<trigger\> AND \<condition\>, THE \<system\> SHALL \<action\>           | Response to a complex event           |
| State-Driven  | WHILE \<state\>, THE \<system\> SHALL \<action\>                              | Behavior during a state               |
| Unwanted      | IF \<condition\>, THEN THE \<system\> SHALL \<action\>                        | Error/exception handling              |
| Optional      | WHERE \<feature\>, THE \<system\> SHALL \<action\>                            | Configurable/optional behavior        |

### Good vs. Bad Requirements

Every acceptance criterion line **must** contain the EARS keyword `SHALL`.
The `lint-spec` validator flags criteria missing `SHALL` as `missing-ears-keyword`.

**Bad** (vague, untestable, no EARS keyword):
- `[05-REQ-1.1] The system should handle errors gracefully.`
- `[05-REQ-1.2] Data processing must be fast and efficient.`
- `[05-REQ-1.3] The system validates user input.`

**Good** (precise, testable, EARS syntax):
- `[05-REQ-1.1] IF an API call returns an HTTP 5xx status, THEN THE system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff starting at 1 second.`
- `[05-REQ-1.2] WHEN the user submits a batch of records, THE system SHALL process all records within 500ms per record.`
- `[05-REQ-1.3] WHEN the user submits input, THE system SHALL validate all fields against the schema and return a 400 response listing each invalid field.`

### Identify Edge Cases

For each requirement, ask:

- What if the input is empty/null?
- What if the input is at boundary values?
- What if the operation fails?
- What if the user is not authorized?
- What if there are concurrent operations?

### Document Structure

Follow this structure:

```markdown
# Requirements Document

## Introduction
Brief description of the system being specified.

## Glossary
Define all domain-specific terms used in this document.

## Requirements

### Requirement N: <Title>

**User Story:** As a <role>, I want <goal>, so that <benefit>.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. <EARS-patterned requirement>
2. <EARS-patterned requirement>
...

#### Edge Cases
1. <EARS-patterned edge-case>
2. <EARS-patterned edge-case>
...
```

### Requirement ID Format

Prefix all requirement IDs with the spec number to create globally unique identifiers.

- Format: `[{NN}-REQ-{N}.{C}]` where NN is the spec number, N is the requirement number, and C is the criterion number.
- Example: `[05-REQ-3.2]` means spec 05, requirement 3, acceptance criterion 2.
- Edge cases use the same prefix: `[05-REQ-3.E1]`.

**Always use bracket format** `[NN-REQ-N.C]` — never the bold format `**NN-REQ-N.C:**`.
The validator flags mixed formats as inconsistent. Bracket format is the standard.

Use these global IDs in cross-spec references, design doc property validation links, and traceability tables.

### Guidelines

- Each requirement must be **testable** and **unambiguous**.
- Use EARS keywords (WHEN, WHILE, WHERE, IF/THEN, SHALL) in CAPS for clarity.
- Number acceptance criteria within each requirement for cross-referencing.
- Include error-handling requirements using the Unwanted (IF/THEN) pattern.
- Include a glossary entry for every domain term or abbreviation.
- **Glossary cross-check:** After writing requirements.md, scan all acceptance
  criteria for domain-specific terms. Every term that is not common English must
  appear in the `## Glossary` section. If you used a term that readers might
  interpret differently, define it.
- Group related requirements logically.
- Add explicit non-functional requirements where relevant (latency, throughput, reliability, security, observability, compatibility).
- For each external dependency, specify failure behavior and fallback strategy.
- Prefer measurable constraints over qualitative language (for example, use concrete timeouts/retry limits).

### Return Value Contracts

When a requirement describes a function whose output is consumed by another
part of the system, the requirement **must** state what the function returns.
Omitting return values is the single most common cause of integration gaps: two
agent sessions implement "create issues" and "label issues" as separate
requirements, each working against the same input, because neither requirement
stated that the issue numbers produced by step 1 must flow into step 2.

**Bad** (action only, return value implicit):
> [05-REQ-5.2] WHEN findings are grouped, THE system SHALL create one platform
> issue per FindingGroup.

**Good** (action + return contract):
> [05-REQ-5.2] WHEN findings are grouped, THE system SHALL create one platform
> issue per FindingGroup AND return the list of created issue references to the
> caller for use in subsequent operations (e.g. label assignment).

Apply this rule to any function that:
- Creates, fetches, or transforms data that a caller needs to act on.
- Is called in one task group and whose result is consumed in another.
- Has a natural "pipe" relationship with a downstream step.

### Verification Methods

Every requirement must have an automated verification method. The traceability table's "Verified By Test" column must reference a specific test file or test function — never "Manual" or "Manual (agent behavior)."

If a requirement describes agent behavior that is hard to test directly:

- Test the **prompt content** to verify the instruction is present.
- Test the **output format** to verify the agent's response structure.
- Use an **integration test with a mock agent** to verify the workflow.

If none of these approaches work, the requirement is likely underspecified — rewrite it to be testable.

### Scope Limits

- A single spec SHOULD contain no more than **10 requirements** (excluding edge cases). If the count exceeds 10, consider splitting into multiple specs with explicit dependencies.
- A single spec SHOULD address **one cohesive feature or concern**. If the PRD describes multiple independent features, create a separate spec for each and link them via the `## Dependencies` table.
- When splitting, prefer vertical slices (end-to-end for one feature) over horizontal slices (all models, then all views, etc.).

### Requirements vs. Design Decisions

A requirement describes **what** the system must do. A design decision
describes **how** it does it. Keep them separate:

- ✅ Requirement: "THE system SHALL ship a configurable command allowlist."
- ❌ Requirement: "THE system SHALL allow `git`, `npm`, `pytest`…" (this is a design decision — the specific commands belong in design.md)

If you find yourself listing specific values, file paths, or implementation details in a requirement, move them to the design document and reference the requirement from there.

---

## Step 4: Create the Design Document

Create a design document at `.agent-fox/specs/{number}_{specification}/design.md` that specifies the high-level
architecture and includes **Correctness Properties** for verification.

### Document Structure

Follow this structure:

```markdown
# Design Document: <Project Name>

## Overview
Brief architectural summary.

## Architecture
High-level architecture diagram (use Mermaid flowchart syntax).

If the system manages persistent state or involves multi-step data transformations,
also include a **data flow or sequence diagram** (Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` syntax) showing how data
moves through the system during the primary use case.

### Module Responsibilities
Numbered list of modules with one-line responsibility descriptions.

## Execution Paths

Trace every user-visible feature from its entry point to its observable side
effect in a numbered call chain. Every function call in the chain must name the
exact module and function. If a return value flows from one call to the next,
show it explicitly.

Example:
```
### Path 1: Hunt scan produces GitHub issues

1. `cli/nightshift.py: night_shift_cmd` — starts engine
2. `nightshift/engine.py: NightShiftEngine._run_hunt_scan` — orchestrates scan
3. `nightshift/engine.py: NightShiftEngine._run_hunt_scan_inner` — calls scanner
4. `nightshift/hunt.py: HuntScanner.run` → `list[Finding]`
5. `nightshift/critic.py: consolidate_findings(findings)` → `list[FindingGroup]`
6. `nightshift/finding.py: create_issues_from_groups(groups, platform)` → `list[IssueResult]`
7. `platform/github.py: GitHubPlatform.create_issue` — side effect: issue created on GitHub
```

**Every path must:**
- Start at a CLI command, public API, or scheduled trigger.
- End at a concrete side effect (file written, API call made, value returned to caller).
- Name the return type of every function whose output is consumed by the next step.
- Be complete enough that a reviewer can verify the path is live by reading only
  the named files.

If a path is not yet designed, write `(TBD)` for missing links — this makes
gaps visible rather than hiding them.

## Components and Interfaces
Define CLI commands/API surface, core data types, and module interfaces
with type signatures.

## Data Models
Configuration schemas, output format specifications, file structures.

## Operational Readiness
Observability hooks, rollout/rollback strategy, migration/compatibility notes.

## Correctness Properties
List of formal properties (see below).

## Error Handling
The error handling table maps error conditions to system behavior.
**Reference requirement IDs rather than restating the requirement text.**

| Error Condition | Behavior | Requirement |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| Config file missing | Use defaults | 05-REQ-2.E1 |
| Invalid JSON | Exit with error code 1 | 05-REQ-2.E2 |

This avoids duplication and ensures the design doc stays in sync with requirements automatically.

## Technology Stack
Technologies used for the implementation. Languages, libraries, 3rd party APIs, protocols, tools, external dependencies (e.g. databases, cloud resources).

## Definition of Done
Criteria for when a task group is complete (see below).

## Testing Strategy
How unit tests, property-based tests, and integration tests validate
the correctness properties.
```

### Correctness Properties

This is the most important section of the design document.

**Definition:** A property is a characteristic or behavior that should hold true
across all valid executions of a system -- a formal statement about what the
system should do. Properties bridge human-readable specifications and
machine-verifiable correctness guarantees.

Each property must follow this format:

```markdown
### Property N: <Short Name>

*For any* <universal quantifier over inputs/states>, <the system component>
SHALL <invariant that must hold>.

**Validates: Requirements X.Y, X.Z**
```

Guidelines for writing properties:

- Start with "*For any*" to express universality.
- Reference specific requirement acceptance criteria numbers.
- Make properties **testable** -- each one should map directly to a
  property-based test (e.g., using Hypothesis in Python, fast-check in JS).
- Cover all critical behaviors: input validation, data transformations, state
  transitions, error handling, configuration precedence.
- Aim for one property per distinct behavioral invariant.
- Include at least one property for failure-path behavior and one for
  idempotency/order guarantees when relevant.
- Ensure each property maps to a concrete test approach (unit, property-based,
  integration, contract).

Coverage Check:

After writing all properties, verify coverage by asking:

1. Does every requirement's primary acceptance criterion have at least one property that validates it?
2. Are the properties focused on the **core behavior** of this spec, not just supporting concerns (config parsing, file I/O)?
3. Is there at least one property for the **happy path**, one for **failure handling**, and one for **boundary conditions**?

If any requirement lacks property coverage, add a property or document why the requirement is not amenable to property-based testing.

### Definition of Done

Include a `## Definition of Done` section in the design document that specifies
when a task group is considered complete. Use this template:

```markdown

## Definition of Done

A task group is complete when ALL of the following are true:

1. All subtasks within the group are checked off (`[x]`)
2. All spec tests (`test_spec.md` entries) for the task group pass
3. All property tests for the task group pass
4. All previously passing tests still pass (no regressions)
5. No linter warnings or errors introduced
6. Code is committed on a feature branch and merged into `develop`
7. Feature branch is merged back to `develop`
8. `tasks.md` checkboxes are updated to reflect completion
```

---

## Step 5: Create the Test Specification

Create a test specification at `.agent-fox/specs/{number}_{specification}/test_spec.md` that
translates every acceptance criterion and correctness property into a concrete,
language-agnostic test contract. This document bridges the gap between
human-readable requirements and executable tests — it defines **what "done"
looks like** before any implementation begins.

The coding agent will translate these test contracts into actual failing tests
(in the project's test framework) as the **first task group** of the
implementation plan.

### Document Structure

Follow this structure:

```markdown
# Test Specification: <Project Name>

## Overview
Brief description of testing approach and how test cases map to requirements
and correctness properties.

## Test Cases

### TS-{NN}-{N}: {Short Name}

**Requirement:** {NN}-REQ-{X}.{Y}
**Type:** unit | integration
**Description:** One-sentence description of what this test verifies.

**Preconditions:**
- System state or setup required before the test runs.

**Input:**
- Concrete input values or descriptions of input shape.

**Expected:**
- Concrete expected output, return value, side effect, or state change.

**Assertion pseudocode:**
```
result = module.function(input)
ASSERT result == expected
```

...

## Property Test Cases

### TS-{NN}-P{N}: {Short Name}

**Property:** Property {N} from design.md
**Validates:** {NN}-REQ-{X}.{Y}, {NN}-REQ-{X}.{Z}
**Type:** property
**Description:** One-sentence description of the invariant being tested.

**For any:** {universal quantifier — describes the input generation strategy}
**Invariant:** {formal statement of what must hold for all generated inputs}

**Assertion pseudocode:**
```
FOR ANY input IN strategy:
    result = module.function(input)
    ASSERT invariant(result, input)
```

...

## Edge Case Tests

### TS-{NN}-E{N}: {Short Name}

**Requirement:** {NN}-REQ-{X}.E{Y}
**Type:** unit
**Description:** One-sentence description of the edge case.

**Preconditions:**
- Edge-case setup (e.g., empty input, boundary value, missing resource).

**Input:**
- The edge-case input.

**Expected:**
- Expected error, fallback behavior, or graceful degradation.

**Assertion pseudocode:**
```
result = module.function(edge_input)
ASSERT result == expected_fallback
```

...

## Coverage Matrix

| Requirement | Test Spec Entry | Type |
|-------------|-----------------|------|
| {NN}-REQ-1.1 | TS-{NN}-1 | unit |
| {NN}-REQ-1.E1 | TS-{NN}-E1 | unit |
| Property 1 | TS-{NN}-P1 | property |
```

### Test Case ID Format

- **Acceptance criterion tests:** `TS-{NN}-{N}` where NN is the spec number
  and N is a running number.
- **Property tests:** `TS-{NN}-P{N}` where N matches the property number
  from design.md.
- **Edge case tests:** `TS-{NN}-E{N}` where N is a running number.

### Guidelines

- **One test case per acceptance criterion.** Every `{NN}-REQ-{X}.{Y}` entry
  in requirements.md must have a corresponding `TS-{NN}-{N}` entry.
- **One property test case per correctness property.** Every `Property N` in
  design.md must have a corresponding `TS-{NN}-P{N}` entry.
- **One edge case test per edge case requirement.** Every `{NN}-REQ-{X}.E{Y}`
  must have a corresponding `TS-{NN}-E{N}` entry.
- **Language-agnostic pseudocode.** Use simple imperative pseudocode for
  assertions. Reference module and function names from design.md interfaces,
  but do not use language-specific syntax.
- **Concrete inputs and outputs.** Avoid vague descriptions like "valid input."
  Provide specific values, shapes, or ranges that the test will use.
- **Preconditions are explicit.** State every assumption about system state,
  configuration, or environment that the test depends on.
- **Test type classification.** Mark each test as `unit`, `integration`, or
  `property` to guide the coding agent's choice of test framework and fixtures.

### Integration Smoke Tests (Mandatory)

For every **Execution Path** defined in `design.md`, write at least one
integration smoke test that traverses the full path from entry point to
observable side effect. This test must **not** mock the component that is
the subject of the path — it may stub only external I/O (network, filesystem,
platform API).

The critical rule: **an integration smoke test cannot pass if the execution
path has a gap.** If `_run_hunt_scan_inner` returns `[]`, the smoke test for
"hunt scan produces GitHub issues" must fail, not pass silently.

Add these tests in a dedicated section:

```markdown
## Integration Smoke Tests

### TS-{NN}-SMOKE-{N}: {Short Name}

**Execution Path:** Path N from design.md
**Description:** One sentence describing what end-to-end behavior is verified.

**Setup:** Describe what is stubbed/mocked (only external I/O; NOT the
components named in the execution path).

**Trigger:** How the path is invoked (CLI call, method call, event).

**Expected side effects:**
- Concrete observable outcomes: API called with specific args, file written,
  return value shape, etc.

**Must NOT satisfy with:** List any mocks that would allow this test to pass
despite the path being broken (these are forbidden in this test).

**Assertion pseudocode:**
```
platform = MockPlatform()
engine = NightShiftEngine(config, platform)   # real engine, not mocked
engine._run_hunt_scan_inner = real_scanner_call  # NOT stubbed
await engine._run_hunt_scan()
ASSERT platform.create_issue.called_count >= 1
```
```

Write one smoke test per execution path. If a path cannot be smoke-tested
(e.g., requires expensive real infrastructure), document why and propose a
minimal integration test that gets as close as possible.

### Coverage Check

After writing all test cases, verify complete coverage:

1. Does every acceptance criterion in requirements.md have at least one
   `TS-{NN}-{N}` entry?
2. Does every correctness property in design.md have a `TS-{NN}-P{N}` entry?
3. Does every edge case requirement have a `TS-{NN}-E{N}` entry?
4. Does the coverage matrix account for every requirement and property?

If any requirement or property lacks a test case, add one or document why
testing is infeasible (this should be rare — see Step 3 guidelines on
testability).

---

## Step 6: Create the Implementation Tasks Document

Create a tasks document at `.agent-fox/specs/{number}_{specification}/tasks.md` that breaks the
implementation into ordered, trackable tasks.

### Document Structure

Follow this structure:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: <Project Name>

<!-- AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
- Implement exactly ONE top-level task group per session
- Task group 1 writes failing tests from test_spec.md — all subsequent groups
  implement code to make those tests pass
- Follow the git-flow: feature branch from develop -> implement -> test -> merge to develop
- Update checkbox states as you go: [-] in progress, [x] complete
-->

## Overview
Brief description of implementation approach and ordering rationale.

## Test Commands

- Spec tests: `<command to run spec tests only>`
- Unit tests: `<specific unit test command>`
- Property tests: `<specific property test command>`
- All tests: `<full test suite command>`
- Linter: `<linter command>`

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Write failing spec tests
  - [ ] 1.1 Set up test file structure
    - Create test files for each module referenced in test_spec.md
    - Use the project's existing test framework and conventions
    - _Test Spec: TS-{NN}-1 through TS-{NN}-N_

  - [ ] 1.2 Translate acceptance-criterion tests from test_spec.md
    - One test function per TS-{NN}-{N} entry
    - Tests MUST fail (assert against not-yet-implemented behavior)
    - _Test Spec: TS-{NN}-1 through TS-{NN}-N_

  - [ ] 1.3 Translate edge-case tests from test_spec.md
    - One test function per TS-{NN}-E{N} entry
    - Tests MUST fail (assert against not-yet-implemented behavior)
    - _Test Spec: TS-{NN}-E1 through TS-{NN}-EN_

  - [ ] 1.4 Translate property tests from test_spec.md
    - One property test per TS-{NN}-P{N} entry
    - _Test Spec: TS-{NN}-P1 through TS-{NN}-PN_

  - [ ] 1.V Verify task group 1
    - [ ] All spec tests exist and are syntactically valid
    - [ ] All spec tests FAIL (red) — no implementation yet
    - [ ] No linter warnings introduced: `<linter command>`

- [ ] 2. <Task Group Name>
  - [ ] 2.1 <Subtask>
    - Implementation details as bullet points
    - _Requirements: X.Y, X.Z_

  - [ ] 2.2 <Subtask>
    ...

  - [ ] 2.V Verify task group 2
    - [ ] Spec tests for this group pass: `<command for TS-{NN}-X entries>`
    - [ ] All existing tests still pass: `<full test suite command>`
    - [ ] No linter warnings introduced: `<linter command>`
    - [ ] Requirements X.Y, X.Z acceptance criteria met

- [ ] 3. Checkpoint - <Module> Complete
  - Ensure all tests pass, ask the user if questions arise.
  - Create or update documentation in e.g. README.md, docs/ etc.

- [ ] 4. <Task Group Name>
  ...

  - [ ] 4.V Verify task group 4
    - [ ] Spec tests for this group pass: `<command for TS-{NN}-X entries>`
    - [ ] All existing tests still pass: `<full test suite command>`
    - [ ] No linter warnings introduced: `<linter command>`
    - [ ] Requirements X.Y, X.Z acceptance criteria met

...

### Checkbox States

| Syntax   | Meaning                |
|----------|------------------------|
| `- [ ]`  | Not started (required) |
| `- [ ]*` | Not started (optional) |
| `- [x]`  | Completed              |
| `- [-]`  | In progress            |
| `- [~]`  | Queued                 |

Tasks are **required by default**. Mark optional tasks with `*` after checkbox: `- [ ]* Optional task`

### Test Task Annotations

- Spec test references: `_Test Spec: TS-{NN}-{N}_` (links subtask to test_spec.md entries)
- Unit/integration tests: `**Validates: Requirements X.Y**`
- Property-based tests: `**Property N: [Name]**` (references design doc properties)
- Add deterministic verification commands when possible (for example, `uv run pytest -q tests/test_foo.py::test_bar`)

## Traceability

Maintain bidirectional links:

- Acceptance criteria → Test spec entries → Tasks → Executable tests
- Property tests → Design correctness properties
- Use glossary terms consistently across all documents

Add a compact traceability table at the bottom of `tasks.md`:

| Requirement | Test Spec Entry | Implemented By Task | Verified By Test |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|

This table makes verification coverage visible and ensures every requirement
has a pre-written test contract, an implementation task, and an executable test.

## Notes
- Implementation constraints and testing guidelines
```

### Guidelines

- **Task group 1 is always "Write failing spec tests."** This is mandatory and
  non-negotiable. The coding agent's first session translates `test_spec.md`
  into executable, failing tests using the project's test framework.
- **Subsequent task groups implement code to make spec tests pass.** Each
  implementation group's verification subtask must reference the specific
  spec tests (by `TS-{NN}-{N}` ID) that should turn green.
- Order tasks so dependencies are built before dependents.
- Group related subtasks under numbered task groups.
- Insert **checkpoint tasks** at logical milestones where all tests should pass.
- Link every implementation subtask to the requirements it satisfies using
  `_Requirements: X.Y_` notation.
- Link every implementation subtask to the test spec entries it should make
  pass using `_Test Spec: TS-{NN}-{N}_` notation.
- Focus on end-to-end testability as early as possible.
- Use markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) so progress can be tracked.
- Include a Notes section with testing strategy and constraints.
- Size task groups for one coding session where practical.
- Add explicit verification commands per task group (for example:
  `uv run pytest -q tests/test_module.py`).
- Include a final traceability table: Requirement -> Test Spec Entry -> Task -> Test.

### Wiring Verification Task (Mandatory Final Group)

The **last task group** of every spec must be a wiring verification group. Its
purpose is to catch integration gaps before the spec is declared done. It
cannot be satisfied by checking that components work in isolation.

**Hard rule:** An execution path from design.md that is not live in production
code **fails** the wiring verification. Writing an erratum or deferring the
wire to a follow-up task does NOT satisfy the checkbox. If a path cannot be
made live within the spec's scope, the spec must either (a) implement the
missing caller, or (b) remove the path from design.md and file an issue for
the deferred work. A completed wiring verification means every path is
traceable in code — no exceptions, no deferrals.

```markdown
- [ ] N. Wiring verification

  - [ ] N.1 Trace every execution path from design.md end-to-end
    - For each path, verify the entry point actually calls the next function
      in the chain (read the calling code, do not assume)
    - Confirm no function in the chain is a stub (`return []`, `return None`,
      `pass`, `raise NotImplementedError`) that was never replaced
    - Every path must be live in production code — errata or deferrals do not
      satisfy this check
    - _Requirements: all_

  - [ ] N.2 Verify return values propagate correctly
    - For every function in this spec that returns data consumed by a caller,
      confirm the caller receives and uses the return value
    - Grep for callers of each such function; confirm none discards the return
    - _Requirements: all_

  - [ ] N.3 Run the integration smoke tests
    - All `TS-{NN}-SMOKE-*` tests pass using real components (no stub bypass)
    - _Test Spec: TS-{NN}-SMOKE-1 through TS-{NN}-SMOKE-N_

  - [ ] N.4 Stub / dead-code audit
    - Search all files touched by this spec for: `return \[\]`, `return None`
      on non-Optional returns, `pass` in non-abstract methods, `# TODO`,
      `# stub`, `override point`, `NotImplementedError`
    - Each hit must be either: (a) justified with a comment explaining why it
      is intentional, or (b) replaced with a real implementation
    - Document any intentional stubs here with rationale

  - [ ] N.5 Cross-spec entry point verification
    - For each execution path whose entry point is owned by another spec
      (e.g., a stream's `run_once()` that is called by a daemon runner
      defined in a different spec), grep the codebase to confirm the entry
      point is actually called from production code — not just from tests
    - If the upstream caller does not exist, either implement it within this
      spec or file an issue and remove the path from design.md
    - This step prevents cascading wiring gaps where spec B assumes spec A's
      wire is live but it was deferred or never landed
    - _Requirements: all_

  - [ ] N.V Verify wiring group
    - [ ] All smoke tests pass
    - [ ] No unjustified stubs remain in touched files
    - [ ] All execution paths from design.md are live (traceable in code)
    - [ ] All cross-spec entry points are called from production code
    - [ ] All existing tests still pass: `<full test suite command>`
```

### Task Group Sizing

- Target **3-6 subtasks** per task group (excluding the verification subtask).
- If a group has more than 6 subtasks, split it into two groups with a checkpoint between them.
- If a group has fewer than 2 subtasks, consider merging it with an adjacent group.
- The verification subtask (N.V) does not count toward the limit.

These are guidelines, not hard rules. A group with 7 subtasks is acceptable if the subtasks are trivially small. A group with 2 subtasks is fine if each is substantial.

## Superseding a Spec

When a new spec replaces an existing one:

1. Add a `## Supersedes` section to the new spec's PRD. **Use exactly this
   heading** — the audit tooling (`af-spec-audit`) only recognizes
   `## Supersedes` (not `## Superseded By`, `## Replaces`, etc.):

```markdown
## Supersedes
- `09_bundled_templates` — fully replaced by this spec.
```

   Each list item **must** use backtick-quoted spec folder name + dash + reason.

2. Add a deprecation banner to the **top** of every file in the old spec folder:

```markdown
⚠️ **SUPERSEDED** by spec `10_direct_template_reads`.
> This spec is retained for historical reference only.
```

3. **Move** the old spec folder into `.agent-fox/specs/archive/`. The planner only
   scans direct children of `.agent-fox/specs/` (`specs_dir.iterdir()`), so anything
   under `.agent-fox/specs/archive/` is invisible to discovery and will not appear in
   the task graph. This keeps the `.agent-fox/specs/` root clean while preserving
   decision history.

```bash
mkdir -p .agent-fox/specs/archive
git mv .agent-fox/specs/09_bundled_templates .agent-fox/specs/archive/09_bundled_templates
```

4. If the old spec folder contains session files or other artifacts, leave
   them in place but do not reference them from the new spec.

## Output Directory

Create all spec files under a `.agent-fox/specs/NN_specification_name` directory (see **Specification folder naming** in Step 2 for how to choose `NN` and the name). Example: `.agent-fox/specs/05_my_feature/`.

```
specs/NN_specification_name/
  requirements.md
  design.md
  test_spec.md
  tasks.md
```

If the PRD was provided as a file, leave it in its original location.
If the PRD was provided as a prompt, save it as `.agent-fox/specs/NN_specification_name/prd.md`, together with all clarifications and additional user input.
If the PRD was provided as a GitHub issue, save the finalized PRD as `.agent-fox/specs/NN_specification_name/prd.md` and post it back to the issue as a comment (see Step 1).

## Completeness Checklist

After generating all 5 spec files, verify the following before presenting to the
user. These checks mirror what `agent-fox lint-spec` validates:

### Requirements (requirements.md)
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion contains the EARS keyword `SHALL`
- [ ] All requirement IDs use bracket format `[NN-REQ-N.C]` (not bold `**NN-REQ-N.C:**`)

- [ ] Each smoke test names which components must NOT be mocked (the ones in the execution path)

### Implementation Tasks (tasks.md)
- [ ] Task group 1 is "Write failing spec tests"
- [ ] Every `TS-NN-N` entry is referenced by at least one task
- [ ] Each task group has a verification subtask (N.V)
- [ ] `## Traceability` section with a table listing every requirement ID
